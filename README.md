## geoip-server

Server part of [Yet Another Flags](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dmchcmgddbhmbkakammmklpoonoiiomk) extension for Google Chrome.

Uses excellent [geoip](https://github.com/kuno/GeoIP) and simple webapp done in [bogart](https://github.com/nrstott/bogart) to resolve domains or IPs into geodata, which is returned in JSON.

Way too simple, but it's enough for the job.
