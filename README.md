## geoip-server

Server part of [Yet Another Flags](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dmchcmgddbhmbkakammmklpoonoiiomk) extension for Google Chrome.

Uses excellent [geoip](https://github.com/kuno/GeoIP) library to resolve IPs into geodata and  [bogart](https://github.com/nrstott/bogart) webapp to serve JSON back over HTTP.

Way too simple, but enough for the job.
